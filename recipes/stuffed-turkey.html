    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Turkey (12 lb, if your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust your cooking time.)</li>
        <li>Stuffing mix</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Bread</li>

        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare turkey: Remove and discard the giblets. 
            Pat the turkey dry with paper towels and place it in a roasting pan.</li>

        <li>Prepare stuffing: Bring the water and butter to a boil. 
            Stir in the stuffing mix, cover, remove from heat, and let rest for 5 minutes. 
            Meanwhile, cook the celery and onion in butter. 
            Add the cooked veggies to the stuffing. Stir in bread pieces, salt, and pepper.</li>
            
        <li>Stuff turkey: Stuff the bread mixture into the body and neck cavities of the turkey. Rub the skin with vegetable oil.</li>
            
        <li>Roast turkey: Loosely cover the bird with aluminum foil. 
            Roast the stuffed turkey in a preheated oven until the thickest part of the thigh reaches 180 degrees F 
            and the interior of the stuffing reaches 165 degrees F. 
            Remove the foil during the last 30 minutes of roasting to brown the skin.</li>

        <li>Enjoy!</li>
